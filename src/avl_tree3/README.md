# A simple AVL tree implementation

This repository contains an AVL tree (AVL) for storing `int`s.  The AVL tree is specified in `avl.h` and implemented in `avl.c`.  There is also a small program in `test_avl.c` to demonstrate the tree.  You can compile the test program using the provided `Makefile` and run it as follows:
```
make
./test_avl
```
