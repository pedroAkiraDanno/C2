    Tree Data Structure


    We read the linear data structures like an array, linked list, stack and queue in which all the elements are arranged in a sequential manner. The different data structures are used for different kinds of data.

    Some factors are considered for choosing the data structure:
      What type of data needs to be stored?: It might be a possibility that a certain data structure can be the best fit for some kind of data.
      
      Cost of operations: If we want to minimize the cost for the operations for the most frequently performed operations. For example, we have a simple list on which we have to perform the search operation; then, we can create an array in which elements are stored in sorted order to perform the binary search. The binary search works very fast for the simple list as it divides the search space into half.
      
      Memory usage: Sometimes, we want a data structure that utilizes less memory.





    A tree is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical data. Suppose we want to show the employees and their positions in the hierarchical form then it can be represented as shown below:

    The above tree shows the organization hierarchy of some company. In the above structure, john is the CEO of the company, and John has two direct reports named as Steve and Rohan. Steve has three direct reports named Lee, Bob, Ella where Steve is a manager. Bob has two direct reports named Sal and Emma. Emma has two direct reports named Tom and Raj. Tom has one direct report named Bill. This particular logical structure is known as a Tree. Its structure is similar to the real tree, so it is named a Tree. In this structure, the root is at the top, and its branches are moving in a downward direction. Therefore, we can say that the Tree data structure is an efficient way of storing the data in a hierarchical way.




    Let's understand some key points of the Tree data structure.
