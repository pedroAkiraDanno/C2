To compile:
  make
To run:
  ./list
To check for memory leaks (this will attempt to run with valgrind):
  make leaks


TODO:
- refactor to get rid of the List struct, so only left with node struct, should make things simpler (arguably)
- add CuTest to project
- create some simple test in separate directory 
- main function should do nothing except run the tests, but should allow option not to run the tests (which will do nothing for the moment)
